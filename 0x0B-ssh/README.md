# Project Title: SSH RSA Key Pair Connection Project 
 
## Background Context 
This project involves connecting to an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server using SSH RSA key pair authentication. You have been provided with an Ubuntu server in a remote datacenter and need to connect to it using SSH with the RSA key that was configured in a previous task. The server information, including IP address and username, can be found in the "My Servers" section of the intranet.

## Learning Objectives 
By the end of this project, you should be able to: 
- Explain the concept of a server and where servers are usually located 
- Understand SSH and its importance in secure connections 
- Create an SSH RSA key pair 
- Connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair 
- Explain the advantages of using  #!/usr/bin/env bash  instead of  /bin/bash  
 
## Requirements 
### General

- All files to be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 
- All files should end with a new line 
- A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder 
- All Bash script files must be executable 
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be  #!/usr/bin/env bash  
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose
