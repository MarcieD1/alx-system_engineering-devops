# RSA Key Pair Generation Script

This Bash script automates the process of generating an RSA key pair, saving the public key, and providing instructions for further steps. It adheres to specific requirements outlined in the project.

### Prerequisites

- This script is intended to be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Ensure you have one of the allowed editors: vi, vim, or emacs.
- All the Bash script files must be executable.
- Shellcheck version 0.7.0 should be used to check for errors.
- The first line of the Bash script must be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- The second line is for  a comment explaining the script's purpose.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing
    ```

3. Execute the script:

    ```bash
    ./generate_rsa_key.sh
    ```

4. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal.

## File Structure

- `generate_rsa_key.sh`: The Bash script for generating the RSA key pair.
- `0-RSA_public_key.pub`: The file where the generated public key is saved.

## Important Notes

- Keep your private key in a secure location.
- If you set a passphrase, ensure it is saved securely.
- Add the generated public key to your intranet profile.
